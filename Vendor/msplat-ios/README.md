# msplat-ios

3D Gaussian Splatting training on iPhone. A fork of
[rayanht/msplat](https://github.com/rayanht/msplat), which built the engine:
the full training pipeline as fused Metal compute kernels, with no dependency
beyond system frameworks.

This fork adds bounded memory, three correctness fixes, an iOS build, and an
example app that takes a COLMAP folder and returns a PLY.

## Memory

| | Before | After | Measured on |
|---|---|---|---|
| Model buffers | 979.1 MB | 239.7 MB | garden, 2000 iters, 2 downscales |
| Transient buffers | 561.4 MB | 353.5 MB | garden, 4 resolution levels, step 600+ |
| Training images | whole dataset | 512 MB budget (iOS default) | `MSPLAT_IMAGE_CACHE_MB` |

- Densification reserved `3 × num_active` for the case where every gaussian
  splits. The real population after a refine step is about 1.2× the count
  before it. Classification now runs first, so the grow asks for what will be
  written.
- Depth-chunk buffers were carried to the end of training after chunking turned
  off. They are released.
- Training images were all decoded up front. A byte-budgeted LRU holds what fits
  and reloads the rest.

## Correctness

**Rasterizer intersection overflow.** The packed buffers were sized
`num_points × 16`; the sort kernel wrote at offsets from a prefix sum over
every tile, bounded by nothing about `num_points`. The overflow landed in the
model, and far enough out faulted the GPU and killed the process's Metal
context. iPhone 15 Pro, 20852 gaussians: 906292 slots needed against 333136
allocated. The kernel now takes a capacity and clamps; buffers are sized from
what the GPU last reported needing.

**Chunk buffers across a resolution change.** The guard compared against a
dimension already updated earlier in the same step, so kernels addressed
6056760 elements of a 5749380-element buffer. PSNR 20.56 → 21.68.

**Non-idempotent intrinsics.** `loadImage` rewrote focal lengths and distortion
coefficients in place, zeroing the coefficients after undistorting — harmless
until a cache evicts and reloads. Intrinsics are re-derived from what the
dataset declared on every call.

## Additions

- COLMAP text models (`cameras.txt` / `images.txt` / `points3D.txt`)
- `.spz` export
- `--stop-densify-at`, capping the gaussian count independently of run length
- XCFramework slices for `macos-arm64`, `ios-arm64` and
  `ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator`, each with its own metallib

## Quick start

```sh
./scripts/build-xcframework.sh
open examples/ios/MsplatExample.xcodeproj
```

See [examples/ios/README.md](examples/ios/README.md).

Swift:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/frs0n/msplat-ios.git", branch: "main")
```

```swift
import Msplat

let dataset = GaussianDataset(path: "path/to/colmap/", downscaleFactor: 2.0)
var config = TrainingConfig()
config.iterations = 2_000
config.stopDensifyAt = 750

let trainer = GaussianTrainer(dataset: dataset, config: config)
for _ in 0..<2_000 {
    let stats = trainer.step()
    print("step=\(stats.iteration) splats=\(stats.splatCount)")
}
trainer.exportPly(to: "output.ply")
```

CLI:

```sh
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build -j
./build/msplat path/to/dataset -n 7000 --eval
```

## Reference

Input: COLMAP (binary or text), Nerfstudio, Polycam.
Output: `.ply`, `.splat`, `.spz`.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `MSPLAT_IMAGE_CACHE_MB` | Image cache budget. Default 512 on iOS, 2048 elsewhere. |
| `MSPLAT_MEM_LOG_EVERY` | Memory breakdown every N steps. |
| `MSPLAT_ISECT_LOG` | Intersection count against capacity at each sample. |

```
MSPLAT_MEM step=1000 splats=232313 phys=2908.4MB accounted=2863.5MB \
           model=239.7MB temp=576.1MB images=2047.7MB imageBudget=2048.0MB
```

`phys` is `phys_footprint`, what jetsam counts. `model` is gaussian parameters
and Adam state, `temp` the cached per-iteration buffers, `images` the decoded
training images.

## Building

```sh
git clone https://github.com/frs0n/msplat-ios.git && cd msplat-ios

cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build -j  # CLI + static lib
pip install -e .                                                     # Python module
./scripts/build-xcframework.sh                                       # XCFramework + metallibs
```

macOS 15+ and Xcode; iOS builds target 18.0. zlib, used for `.spz`, ships with
the OS.

`MsplatCore.xcframework` and the metallibs are build outputs, not committed. Run
`scripts/build-xcframework.sh` before building the Swift package or the example
app, and again after any C API change — the Swift side otherwise links a stale
header without complaint.

## Reproducibility

Training is not bit-reproducible: the rasterizer backward scatters gradients
with relaxed float atomics, so accumulation order varies between runs and
gaussians sitting exactly on `densifyGradThresh` flip. Over seven runs of garden
at 2000 iterations, PSNR fell in 26.75–26.93 and the final gaussian count in
231.6K–237.1K.

## Engine

One training step, dispatched into a single Metal command encoder:

```
Forward:
  project_and_sh_forward     fused 3D→2D projection + spherical harmonics
  prefix_sum + scatter       gaussian→tile intersection mapping
  bitonic_sort_per_tile      tile-local depth sort + inline data packing
  nd_rasterize_forward       per-pixel alpha compositing (16×16 tiles)
  ssim_h_fwd + ssim_v_fwd    separable 11-tap SSIM + L1 loss

Backward:
  ssim_h_bwd + ssim_v_bwd    separable SSIM gradient
  rasterize_backward         per-pixel backward compositing
  project_and_sh_backward    fused projection + SH VJP + SH Adam update
  fused_adam (×4 groups)     optimizer step
  accumulate_grad_stats      gradient norms for densification
```

Upstream's [README](https://github.com/rayanht/msplat) covers the design behind
this and carries M4 Max benchmarks against gsplat. This fork has not re-run
them.
